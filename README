Instructions

1. You need Qt5 for desktop or device. See http://qt-project.org
2. Build with qmake
3. Run "quint" making sure qml files are in same directory

In-env instructions are in the HelloWorld.qml first shown.

When you exit, the env will save the last valid program into 
Scratchpad.qml and reload that next time it is run.

Still to-do:
1. Show QML parsing, runtime and Shader compilation errors
2. Track down Qt5 bugs that cause crashes when compiling half finished programs
3. Better saving system
